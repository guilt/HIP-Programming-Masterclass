# HIP Programming Masterclass

## What is It?

CUDA Examples but ported to work with ROCM/HIP.

## Why?

I currently do not have a CUDA compatible card. During the pandemic, the
NVIDIA card prices were insane due to the miners. I ended up getting a
RX 6900XT at sale price (wasn't cheap either). Hence, I decided to
make the best of this course.
